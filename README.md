Particulary useful to remove incorrect data after distillation.

## Run

I am not going to build the app for each system and especially signing,
because it's an unnecessary headache.

So you will need to run it yourself.
Before you start you need to have Npm and Cargo installed on your system.

Clone repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/roman-koshchei/yolo-dataset-visualizer.git
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run:

```bash
npm run tauri dev
```
